 *
 * This file contains inverse-DCT routines that produce reduced-size output:
 * either 4x4, 2x2, or 1x1 pixels from an 8x8 DCT block.
 *
 * The implementation is based on the Loeffler, Ligtenberg and Moschytz (LL&M)
 * algorithm used in jidctint.c.  We simply replace each 8-to-8 1-D IDCT step
 * with an 8-to-4 step that produces the four averages of two adjacent outputs
 * (or an 8-to-2 step producing two averages of four outputs, for 2x2 output).
 * These steps were derived by computing the corresponding values at the end
 * of the normal LL&M code, then simplifying as much as possible.
 *
 * 1x1 is trivial: just take the DC coefficient divided by 8.
 *
 * See jidctint.c for additional comments.
