- INTRODUCTION
The axxPac JPEG plugin allows you to view JPEG images stored
on a SmartMedia card directly on any axxPac equipped Palm.

For details about the axxPac have a look at www.axxpac.de

- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The axxPac JPEG plugin requires your palm to be axxPac
equipped and you need at least version 2.08 of the 
axxPac Shell and version 1.08 of the axxPac Drviver. Both 
can be found at www.axxpac.de

- INSTALLATION
To install the plugin, just hotsync axxPacJPEG.prc to your
Palm device. The axxPac JPEG plugin is an extension for 
the axxPac Shell. It does not show up as a seperate program 
in the launcher. Instead it adds the capability to view JPEG 
images directly to the Shell program.

- USAGE
Once the JPEG plugin is installed on the palm, a new icon
will show up for all JPEG images (all files with 'jpg' extension) 
stored on the SmartMedia. To view an image, just click on the
image in 'move' or 'copy' mode or on the icon in every mode
or select the 'view' button in the file info dialog.

The images will be displayed shrunken by 8 in both directions. 
A 1280x1024 image for example will be scaled to 160x128 and
will fit exactly onto the screen. A 1600x1200 image will be 
cropped left and right to fit onto the screen. And images smaller
than 1280x1024 will be displayed centered on the screen.

'Will there ever be a version of this plugin that supports
scrollable full size pictures to store maps etc' might be
your next question. Despite the fact that this would be a very
nice feature, this is nearly impossible with the DragonBall
CPU used in the palms. By reducing the image size by a factor
of 8 in both directions, some of the most complex tasks in
JPEG image decompression could be skipped. A complete decompression 
of full size JPEG images is far beyond the capabilities of
your favorite handheld.

- SCREEN ADJUSTMENT
In some cases, depending on the display hardware used in your
palm, the OS version installed and hacks like e.g. nostreak
or streakhack installed, your display may flicker or require
contrast adjustment when displaying the image.

To adjust the display settings select the 'config plugin' menu
in axxPac Shell program. Select 'config' in the row of the the 
JPEG plugin (usually the first row) and select the desired 
refresh mode.

- REGISTRATION
