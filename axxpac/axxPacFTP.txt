- INTRODUCTION
The axxPac FTP client allows you to up- and download files
from and to FTP servers to and from your axxPac SmartMedia
card.

For details about the axxPac have a look at www.axxpac.de

- WHY DO I WANT TO ACCESS A FTP SERVER?
Because this way you can do lots of cool things with your
axxPac. You can download palm software (PRC and PDB files)
directly to your SmartMedia card and then use the axxPac
shell to install these files on your palm.

Or you can take some snapshots with your digital camera,
select the best shots with the axxPac JPEG plugin and finally
upload them to your homepage using the axxPac FTP client.

- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The axxPac FTP requires your palm to be axxPac equipped 
and you need at least version 1.11 of the axxPac Drviver. 
Both can be found at www.axxpac.de

- INSTALLATION
To install the FTP client, just hotsync axxPacFTP.prc to your
Palm device. After successful installation, you'll find
an FTP icon to be added to the launcher application.

- USAGE
To start working with the FTP client you need to have a
working network setup for your palm. This may either be
via the Palm Pilot Modem or via a direct PPP connection
either via RS232 using your cradle or HotSync cable or
via IrDA.

After the connection to the network services is established,
the program asks you to specify the name of the FTP server
to contact (e.g. ftp.microsoft.com) and the user name
and password to use. For public servers (like the microsoft
server), you usually use 'ftp' or 'anonymous' as the user
name and your email address for the password. 

As soon as you are logged into the server, you can walk
around in the file system of that server and upload and
download files.

- HOW TO SETUP NETWORKING WITH THE PALM
There a several ways of connecting the palm to the internet.

For details on how to connect to the net using the
palm pilot modem refer to the manual of your palm
pilot modem.

To connect via a Siemens S25 mobile or via a linux
machine e.g. refer to
  http://www.palmobil.de/palm2s25-eng/index.html

To connect via your Win95/98 PC at home e.g. refer to
  http://www.mochasoft.dk/palm.html#palmppp

- KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS

- The current version does not support dynamic links.
  Links are not displayed and can't be selected.

- The current version does not cope with filenames
  containing spaces.

- The current version parses the file listing according 
  to the unix ls command. Tests with a Windows2000 based
  server (ftp.microsoft.com) showed, that they are using
  the same pattern. However, there may be servers out
  there using their own format. So if you get some
  weird file listings or even crashes whenever connecting
  to a particular server, please try to log onto that
  server from your host and see whether a 'ls' gives
  you some strange formatted output or just email me
  the server name (if it's a public server, otherwise
  you have a problem :-).
