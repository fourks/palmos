# PalmOS

This repository contains the source code of some of my PalmOS projects.

Some of them can still be found on my [PalmOS pages](http://harbaum.org/till/palm/) and in various other places in the internet.

I haven't touched this code for over 25 years and don't have the hardware
anymore.

Most of this code is meant to be under Apache 2.0 license. If you find
files stating otherwise please feel free to submit a pull
request. Also if you find files which you think shouldn't be there
please also drop me a note or submit a pull request.

The exception from this rule is Elite which was originally written by
Christian Pinder. Please refer to his site at http://www.new-kind.com/
for details about the license of that code.

This is here for those who still care for these devices.
