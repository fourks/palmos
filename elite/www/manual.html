<h2>History</h2>

This Palm&nbsp;OS port was written by me (Till Harbaum). Some of the code
of this game is based on 
<a href="http://www.cjpinder.clara.co.uk/elite.html">Elite - The New
Kind</a> by Christian Pinder.  Some of the Newkind code is based
on an Acorn BBC Elite written by Ian Bell and David Braben.<p>

<dt><b>Operating System:</b></dt><dd>

Elite for Palm&nbsp;OS requires at least Palm&nbsp;OS 3.3. Later
versions of Palm&nbsp;OS e.g. lack the required support for grayscale
video.</dd><p>

<dt><b>Video:</b></dt><dd>

Elite for Palm&nbsp;OS requires a Palm&nbsp;OS compatible handheld
device with a video unit capable of doing a 160x160 color video mode
with 8 bit display depth or grayscale video with 4 bit display
depth.<p>

Currently, all existing color devices and most of the grayscale 
devices are supported. All Palms later than the first Palm III
model support grayscale video with 4 bit display depth (16 shades
of gray).<p>

The game works on machines with Hires video like the newer Sony Clies,
but it does not make use of the increased resolution. Instead it
temporarily switches these such machines into a 160x160 compatibility
mode and restores the Hires video mode after the game has been
stopped. On some models it may be necessary to enable Hires support in
the operating system for the game. Some devices have a Hires panel in
the preferences application that can be used to make Elite for
Palm&nbsp;OS to run on certain Hires machines.
</dd>

<dt><b>Sound:</b></dt><dd>

Elite for Palm&nbsp;OS make use of multi channel midi playback for the
intro screen. This is currently only supported on the Sony Clie
series. Genuine Palms will only play one single sound channel which
greatly decreases playback quality.</dd>

<h2>Installation</h2>

The game comes in one single file named
<tt><b>Elite.prc</b></tt>. Please install this file onto your Palm&nbsp;OS
machine as usual. Start the game by tapping the Elite icon.<p>

If you own a Palm M505 or M515 you might install
<tt><b>RumbleLibM50x.prc</b></tt> as well. This library provides some API
to the rumble/vibration alarm unit inside these machines and will
allow you to experience some kind of force feedback during the game.
Please read the <tt><b>readme.txt</b></tt> of the rumble lib for more
details on this.<p>

<h2>The game</h2>

See the <a href="manual.htm"> Elite Space Traders Flight Manual</a>
for details about the gameplay. A <a href="manual.pdf">PDF version of
the Flight Manual</a> is available as well. This document only convers
the specifics of Elite for Palm&nbsp;OS.

<h3>Game controls</h3>

Elite for Palm&nbsp;OS makes use of many input methods available on 
Palm devices:

<h4>Touch Screen</h4>

The touch screen is used for most controls while docked. It is
e.g. used to equip the ship, to control the trading system and to use
the navigation controls. See the section <a href=#onscreen>
on-screen controls</a> for details.

<h4>Hard Keys</h4> 

The hard keys below the palm screen are used for in-flight
control. They are used to roll the ship right or left, to climb and
dive, to increase and decrease the ship speed and to fire the lasers
or launch missiles.<p>

The Hard Keys can be configured for right and left handed layout:
<center><img src="hard-keys.gif"></center>

<h4>Silkpad and graffity area</h4>

These can be used as an alternate input during flight. Its setup
changes together with the Hard Keys according to right or left handed
layout.  In right handed mode, direction input is mapped to the text
input area and fire/speed is mapped to the number input area. In left
handed mode, both areas are exchanged, but the sizes remain the same:
<p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr><td align=center><img src="graffiti_right.gif"></td>
    <td align=center><img src="graffiti_left.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>Right handed layout</td>
    <td align=center>Left handed layout</td></tr>
</table></dd><p>

By using the <a href="../silkjoy">Silkscreen joystick panel</a> the
direction input can be reconfigured to match the needs of special
input devices attached to the graffiti area.<p>

<h4>The PalmGamePad</h4>

The <a href="http://www.palmgamepad.com">PalmGamePad</a> is an
external device that is attached to the palms hotsync port and which
provides additional direction and function keys especially suited for
gaming. Since the layout of this device is fixed, the function mapping
is not affected by the left/right handed setting:<p>

<center><img src="gamepad.gif"></center>

<h4>Sony Jog Dial</h4>

The jog dial present on some Sony Clie devices can be used in flight
mode to increase and decrease the ships speed.  Pushing the jog dial
will arm/unarm the missiles. The back button toggles between 
front and rear view during flight.

<a name=onscreen><h3>On-screen controls</h3></a>

The instruments for flight and combat control are placed beneath the 
main screen:<p>

<center><img src="scanner.gif"></center>

The instruments in detail:

<h4>Front/Rear Shields</h4>

These indicators display the status of the front and rear
shields. These shields protect the ship from damage due to laser fire,
missiles, collisions with other ships and missaligned docking
procedures.<p>

If the shields are down, damage directly affects the enery.<p>

Damaged shields are recharged from the energy banks.

<h4>Fuel gauge</h4>

The fuel gauge displays the remaing fuel for the hyperspace
engines. The amount of remaining fuel limits the distance of a
hyperspace jump. With maximum fuel, a distance of 7.0 light years can
be traveled during a hyperspace jump.<p>

Fuel is available in all space stations. If the ship is equipped with
fuel scoops, fuel can be taken from solar radiation by flying at high
speed as close to the sun as possible without damaging the ship (see
<a href=#cabtemp>Cabin Temerature</a>).<p>

No fuel is required for flying in intersolar distances and during
inter-galactic hyperjumps.

<a name=cabtemp><h4>Cabin Temperature</h4></a>

The cabin temperature depends on the ships distance to the
sun. If the temperature gets too high, the ship takes serious
damage. Extremely caution is required while approaching the sun
for <a href=#fuelscoops>fuel scooping</a>.

<a name=lasertemp><h4>Laser Temperature</h4></a>

The ships lasers are very powerful devices and require a seperate
cooling system. If continuously fired, the cooling system will be
unable to keep the laser temperature low. If the laser temperature
exceeds the maximum value, the laser fire rate is reduced to prevent
damage.<p>

Since all lasers use the same cooling system, all lasers are affected
simultanously.

<h4>Altimeter</h4>

The altimeter shows the distance to the planet. The Cobra MK3 is not
suited for operation within a planets atmosphere and will be destroyed
if the altitude falls below a certain value.

<h4>Missiles</h4>

This instrument shows the number and status of the installed missiles.
Green indicates a installed missile, yellow indicates an armed missile
and red and armed missile locked onto a target. Missiles can only be
launched if their status indicator shows red.<p>

Only one missile can be armed and locked onto a target at once.

<a name=statusind><h4>Status Indicator</h4></a>

This device indicates whether the ship is within the range of a
space station (indicated by a green S) or if the E.C.M system
hast been activated (indicated by a red E).

<h4>Compass</h4>

If the ship is not within the range of a space station (see 
<a href=#statusind>status indicator</a>), this device
shows the direction to the nearest planet. If the ship is 
within the range of a space station, the compass shows the
direction to this station.<p>

A green (or light) light in the center of the compass indicates
the station or planet being directly in front of the ship. A red (or
dark) light indicates, that the station or planet is exactly behind
the ship.

<h4>Proximity Sensor</h4>

This device shows the current system status. If the status is "clean",
interspace jumping (using the jump icon <img src="but_jump.gif">) is
possible.<p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>Color Display</td><td>Grayscale Display</td><td>Meaning</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>green</td><td align=center>black/none</td><td>clean (no object within radar range)</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>red</td><td align=center>light</td><td>object within radar range and energy low</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<h4>Radar scanner</h4>

This is the primary instrument for combat. It shows the position and
status of all objects within the range of this powerful device. Each
object is represented by a marker. White markers indicate ordinary
objects like trading ships or boulders and meteors. Hostile objects
are displayed in yellow and blinking. Missiles use pink markers and
police ships are blue. If these are hostile, they blink as well. Space
stations are represented by green markers.<p>

This powerful instrument allows the pilot to determine the position of
a object in all three axes.

<h4>Speed</h4>

This indicator shows the speed of the ship. If the speed exceeds a
certain value, the speed indicators color changes to red. The Cobra
Mk3's main engines have been modified to be operated continously at
maximum speed without taking damage.

<h4>Roll/Dive/Climb</h4>

These indicators show the current movement around the ships axes. The
effect of the automatic daming system installed on the Cobra Mk3 can
be seen at these instruments.

<h4>Energy</h4>

This device shows the ships main energy. This energy is requiered the
E.C.M system and the shields. If the ship runs out of energy, the ship
will be destroyed.<p>

Energy is automatically refilled at a certain rate. The refill
rate can be increased with an <a href=#extraenergy>additional 
energy unit</a>.

<h3>Buying and selling cargo</h3>

<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva">

One of the ways of making money is by buying and selling cargo at the
space stations and trade them between different stations. The prices
and the sortment of items to trade differ from station to station and
depend on the planets economy. Some items like Alien Items can only be
sold on space stations and will never be available for purchase.<p>

The maximum amount of cargo that can be carried on board the Cobra Mk3
is 20 tons. This capacity can be increased to 35 tons with an <a
href=#extracargo>additional cargo bay</a>. While most items are sold
in quantities of tons and will fill up the cargo may very fast, some
items like gem stones are sold in gramm or kilogramm units. These
light items are not stored in the main cargo bay and can be traded
in huge amounts.<p>

Items are bought and sold in the market screen activated by the market
icon <img src="but_market.gif">. Tap the green arrows to move cargo
from the station stock to your ships cargo bay and the red arrows to
return items from the ship to the station.

<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, geneva">

The Cobra Mk3 is sold with few optional equipment installed. Each
Cobra comes with a front pulse laser and three missiles installed. The
Cobra can be equiped with additional weapons and other add-ons
available on the space stations. The amount and type of additional
equipment available on a space station depends on the technological
level of the associated planet.<p>

In order to purchase an additional item for your ship, select the
equip icon <img src="but_equip.gif"> and tap the corresponding
white entry in the equipment table. Entries displayed in red are still
missing on your ship, but are still too expensive. Green items are
already equipped.<p>

The additional equipment items available are:

<h4>Fuel</h4>

Fuel does not really qualify for additional equipment. Fuel is
required to operate the hyperspace engines and is available on every
space station. The Cobra Mk3 can hold fuel for up to 7.0 light years.

<h4>Missiles</h4>

Your Cobra Mk3 comes equiped with three missiles. Each missile can
only be used once. At most four missiles can be installed on your ship
at once.<p>

The use of missiles includes three steps:<p>

First the missile has to be armed using the <img
src="but_missile.gif"> icon (as an alternative, Sony Clie users may
use the jog dial to arm a missile, PalmGamePad users may use the left
fire button). The fact, that a missile is armed is indicated by a red
target circle in the main 3d view.<p>

An armed missile is locked onto the first target, that appears in the
target circle. A armed or targeted missile can be disarmed at any
point using the same techniques that were used for arming the
missile.<p>

A targetted missile is launched with the fire button. 

<h4>Pulse Laser</h4>

One of these very reliable devices is initially installed on the front
mounting only. Additional lasers for rear and side mounting can be
installed.<p>

Pulse lasers are available on planets with tech. level 3 or above for
400 Credits each.

<h4>Beam Laser</h4>

Beam lasers are more advanced and powerful (and expensive) devices
than pulse lasers. Once you become experienced (and wealthy) enough,
you can all four mountings on your ship with this fine piece of
technology.<p>

Beam lasers are available on planets with tech. level 4 or above for
1000 Credits each.

<h4>Military Laser</h4>

Military lasers are the most sophisticated pieces of technology, you
can equip your ship with. These are devices to spread fear over the
galaxy.<p>

Military lasers are available on planets with tech. level 10 or above for
6000 Credits each.

<h4>Mining Laser</h4>

Mining lasers are special devices required for asteroid mining. Equip
your ship with at least one mining laser and 
<a href=#fuelscoops>fuel scoops</a> to fragment asteroids into small
pieces which can then be taken into the cargo bay using the fuel
scooping mechanism.<p>

Mining lasers are available on planets with tech. level 10 or above for
800 Credits each.

<a name=extracargo><h4>Large cargo bay</h4></a>

With the large cargo bay, your cargo space can be expanded from 20 tons
to 35 tons.<p>

The large cargo bay is available on all planets for 400 Credits.

<a name=ecm><h4>ECM System</h4></a>

The ECM System provides an efficient protection agains missile
attacks. It uses an electromagnetic field to destroy incoming
missiles. The ECM system is sourced from the main energy
banks and it is activated with the <img src="but_ecm.gif"> icon.<p>

The ECM System is available on planets with tech. level 2 or above for
600 Credits each.

<a name=fuelscoops><h4>Fuel Scoops</h4></a>

Fuel scoops enable you to obtain hyperspace fuel from solar radiation
by flying at high velocity as close to the sun as possible. In
addition, fuel scoops may be used for asteroid mining or to move other
objects like e.g. cargo casnisters from free space into the cargo
bay.<p>

Fuel Scoops are available on planets with tech. level 5 or above for
525 Credits each.

<a name=pilot><h4>Docking Computer</h4></a>

The docking computer can be attached to the ship's flight control system
and enable it to dock the ship automatically. The docking computer is
activated using the <img src="but_pilot.gif"> icon.<p>

Docking computers are available on planets with tech. level 9 or above for
1500 Credits.

<a name=escape><h4>Escape Capsule</h4></a>

If equiped with a escape capsule, you can always abandon your ship
using the <img src="but_bomb.gif"> icon. Your capsule will then be
tracked to the nearest space station. You will only loose your
cargo. You cash is saved and the insurance, that comes with your
escape capsule will cover the ship itself and all the equipment you
had installed on your ship.<p>

Since your police record is tied to a unique marker on your ships
hull, the replacement ship will cause your police record to be cleared.<p>

Escape Capsules are available on planets with tech. level 6 or above for
1000 Credits.

<a name=bomb><h4>Energy Bomb</h4></a>

This is the most powerful weapon you can equip your ship with. The
energy bomb can used one time and will detroy all vessels, asteroids,
missiles and other objects within the range of your ship, leaving your
ship intact.<p>

Energy bombs are available on planets with tech. level 7 or above for
900 Credits.

<a name=extraenergy><h4>Extra Energy Unit</h4></a>

The extra energy unit fill speed up the rate, at which your energy
banks are automatically refilled.<p>

Extra Energy Units are available on planets with tech. level 8 or
above for 1500 Credits.

<a name=galactic><h4>Galactic Hyperdrive</h4></a>

The galactic hyperdrive allows you to jump between galaxies. The
galactic hyperdrive can only be used once using the <img
src="but_ghyper.gif"> icon.<p>

Galactic Hyperdrives are available on planets with tech. level 10 or
above for 5000 Credits.
