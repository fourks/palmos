Rumble Library for M50X - (c) 2002 by Till Harbaum

The palm M500, M505 and M515 have built-in rumble/vibration
support. Unfortunately the PalmOS support works for alarms only and
does now allow for the kind of vibration effects required for games 
and detailed tactile feedback.

In order to get rumble support for Elite for PalmOS on your M500,
M505 or M515 just install the RumbleLibM50x.prc together with the game.

WARNING: Use this library on your own risk! Since there's no
appropriate PalmOS support, this library directly accesses the 
rumble hardware. This is only tested with the M500, M505 and M515 and might
cause major problems on other systems. Please do not install the lib
if in doubt.

Have fun,
  Till
