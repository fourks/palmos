obvious errors in newkind code:

- The flags of a newly created planet/sun are taken from
  undefined memory. The results are unpredictable (ever
  seen an angry planet?). 

- intro1 places a NULL ship with negative direction at init
  which is immediately removed.

- tidy_matrix relies on some vector elements never 
  becoming 0 since it's dividing by them without prior
  testing which may result in a division by zero

- distance calculation for objects has a integer overflow
  (e.g. distance of planet/sun/station is nonsense)

- placement of station relies on wierd station distance (station is
  placed at offset 65792 and is removed if > 57344)

- in auto dock, ship.flags is not initialized

- init matrix is wrong "handed" and is corrected by tidy matrix.

- cobra_lone is also used as a pack hunter (due to sidewinder+7), 
  moray is never created, since it's not in reach of cobra_lone+3

- ship structures size does not match graphical size -> targetting ships
  station etc is not consistant

- explosion delta is never initialized

- missile target is not lost when entering hyperspace

- ships launch at 90 wrong z angle from station
