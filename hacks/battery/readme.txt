battery.prc and battry33.prc     (c) 1999 Till Harbaum
------------------------------------------------------

This hack replaces the static battery symbol in the 
launcher with a customizable battery symbol.

battery.prc:
  - works with OS 3.0 and OS 3.1
  - for use with Alkaline, NiCad/NiMH and Lithium 
    batteries

battry33.prc:
  - works with OS 3.3
  - for use with Alkaline, NiCad, Lithium, Rechargeable
    Alkaline and NiMH batteries

Installing the wrong version will result in ugly display
but does not harm the system.
