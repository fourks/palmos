Grayscale Hack 1.0                       Till Harbaum
-----------------------------------------------------

This hack allows to configure the grayscale settings 
for 100% PalmOS compliant applications using the 2 bpp
(black, white and two shades of gray) grayscale modes.
This hack does not affect/work with applications that
access the video hardware directly and bypass or overwrite
the grayscale settings set by the operating system.

This hack was developed for use with PalmBoy version 3.2 
and later (see http://palmboy.suburbia.com.au).

The hack is distributed under the gnu public license
(GPL). Please see the file COPYING for details.

Have fun,
